# Amico

A simple rails app I use to practice my Italian.

## Production

For now, run `good_job` on the web server process

```
GOOD_JOB_EXECUTION_MODE=async rails server
```

## Development

An admin user is created automatically when the database is seeded, with
username `admin@languagelads.com` and password `QTVE9s%Y!!tBfa`.
